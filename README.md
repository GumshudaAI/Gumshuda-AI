### FAQ

About Gumshuda AI
üöÄ Generative AI App for Lost and Found Belongings

Using Open AI's clip-vit-large model, this app creates image embeddings and searches them using natural language, powered by a vector database.
üéØ Objective:
Our innovative application aims to revolutionize and streamline the process of locating and reuniting lost objects with their rightful owners. The current system, characterized by delayed response times, limited reporting options, and inefficient communication among authorities, often leaves individuals in distress with no viable means to track their missing possessions.


What is Gumshuda AI?

üß† It's a Generative AI-powered platform for Lost and Found belongings.

How can I use it?

üì¶ Due to resource constraints, it's not hosted/deployed to a service yet. We hope to achieve it soon.

Where is the GitHub repository for it?

üíª There is some pending code cleaning going on before the project is made open source for everyone to contribute and use.

How does it work?

üõ†Ô∏è It uses the clip-vit-large model to create a combination of sparse and dense vector embeddings and stores them in a vector database (in my case- pinecone). It utilizes the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) to find the closest matching vectors and returns the results accordingly.

What is Talaash AI?

üîÑ It's the previous name/version of Gumshuda AI.

# How to setup locally?

## Backend:

1. go to the `/backend` folder.
2. create python environment `python -m venv venv`
3. activate that environment `source venv/bin/activate` or `source venv/Scripts/activate`
4. install the dependancies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. run the server by `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
6. server is running on port 8000

OR
(incase the above doesn't work, you can switch to running the docker container)
`docker build . -t my-image`
`docker run my-image`

## Frontend

There are two types of frontend available.
`/frontend` has the react + `scss` based frontend (hosted on vercel well)
`/new-frontend` has the react + mui components (not hosted, but looks better)

1. go to the respective folders
2. `npm intall/yarn install/pnpm install`
3. `npm run dev/pnpm run dev` etc command to run the local frontend server

## Sample ENV File

### For backend

Create .env file in the backend directory with the following format-

```
PINECONE_API_KEY= <get this on https://www.pinecone.io>
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=<get this on https://www.pinecone.io>
IMG_DB_API_KEY=<get this one https://api.imgbb.com/>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<open ai api key>
INDEX_NAME=<name which you have provided to your database index>
```

Pinecone is needed to store vector embeddedings
ImgBB is used to upload images as a blog object, S3 can be configured to be used here as well
OpenAI API key is used to create embeddedings via clip-v2 model. This can also be done locally by importing the model in the RAM.

### For Frontend:

Add .env file in the frontend directeory with the value of

```
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

## Deployment:

`frontend` is deployed on vercel

Build the docker image using the Dockerfile
and deploy the Docker file in any of the supported services.

## Managing Python Versions with conda

This project requires Python 3.9.
Conda allows you to easily manage multiple Python versions on your system.
Here's how to get started:

1. Check Existing Environments (Optional):

To see a list of conda environments on your system, run the following command in your terminal:

`conda env list`
This will display all environments and indicate the currently active one with an asterisk (\*).

2. Create a New Environment (if needed):

If you don't have a Python 3.9 environment, create one using this command:

`conda create -n myenv python=3.9`
Replace myenv with your preferred environment name. This command creates a new environment named myenv with Python 3.9 installed.

3. Activate the Environment:

Once you have a Python 3.9 environment, activate it using:

`conda activate myenv`
This activates the myenv environment, making Python 3.9 the active version for your project.

4. Verify Python Version:

You can verify the active Python version by running:

`python --version`
This should print Python 3.9.x (or similar) confirming successful activation.

5. Deactivate the Environment (Optional):

When you're done working on your project, you can deactivate the environment using:

`conda deactivate`
This deactivates the myenv environment and returns you to the base environment.
